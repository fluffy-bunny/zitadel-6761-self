## Scope and responsibility

Under this Agreement, the Processor shall process Personal Data on behalf of the Customer.

This Annex applies to all processing of Customer's data (including data of the users of Customer's organization) with reference to persons ("**Personal Data**") which is related to the Agreement and which is carried out by the Processor, its employees or agents.

The Customer shall be responsible for compliance with the statutory provisions of the data protection laws, in particular for the lawfulness of the transfer of data to the Processor as well as for the lawfulness of the data processing.

The Processor is responsible for taking appropriate technical and organizational protection measures so that its processing complies with the legal requirements and ensures the protection of the rights of the Data Subjects.

## Obligations of the processor

### Bound by directions

The Processor processes personal data in accordance with its privacy policy (cf. [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy)) and on the documented directions of the Customer. The initial direction result from the Agreement. Subsequent instructions shall be given either in writing, whereby e-mail shall suffice, or orally with immediate written confirmation.

If the Processor is of the opinion that a direction of the Customer violates the Agreement, the GDPR or other data protection provisions of the EU, EU Member States or Switzerland, it shall inform the Customer thereof and shall be entitled to suspend the Processing until the instruction is withdrawn or confirmed.

###  Obligation of the processing persons to confidentiality

The Processor shall ensure that the persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality, unless they are already subject to an appropriate statutory duty of confidentiality.

### Technical and organizational measures

The Processor has taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures, maintains them for the duration of the Processing and updates them on an ongoing basis in accordance with the current state of technology.

The technical and organizational security measures are described in more detail in the [annex](#annex-regarding-security-measures) to this appendix.

### Involvement of subcontracted processors

A current and complete list of involved and approved sub-processors can be found at [https://zitadel.com/trust/](https://zitadel.com/trust/).

The Processor is entitled to involve additional sub-processors. In this case, the Processor shall inform the Responsible Party about any intended change regarding sub-processors and update the list at <https://zitadel.com/trust>. The Customer has the right to object to such changes. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement within 90 days of receipt of the objection by the Processor, the Customer may terminate the Agreement extraordinarily.

The Processor obligates itself to impose on all sub-processors, by means of a contract (or in another appropriate manner), the same data protection obligations as are imposed on it by this Annex. In particular, sufficient guarantees shall be provided that the appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented in such a way that the processing by the sub-processor is carried out in accordance with the legal requirements. If the sub-processor fails to comply with its data protection obligations, the processor shall be liable to the customer for this as for its own conduct.

### Assistance in responding to requests

The Processor shall support the Customer as far as possible with suitable technical and organizational measures in fulfilling its obligation to respond to requests to exercise the data subject's rights. The parties shall agree separately on the compensation of the Processor for this.

### Further support for the customer

The Processor shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to it, assist the Customer in complying with its obligations in connection with the security of the processing, any notifications of personal data breaches, and any data protection impact assessments.

### Deletion or destruction after termination

Upon Customer's request, the Processor shall delete personal data received after the end of the agreement, unless there is a legal obligation for the Processor to store or further process such data.

### Information and control rights of the customer

The Processor shall provide the Customer with all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this annex. It shall enable and contribute to audits, including inspections, carried out by the Customer or an auditor appointed by the Customer.

The procedure to be followed in the event of directions that are presumed to be unlawful is governed by the section [Bound by directions](#bound-by-directions) of this Appendix.
